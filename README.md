# Pull Request Diff Copy

When you create a Pull Request, you are actually doing a diff between two branches. It makes sense to get a copy of the diff result for other usage. For example, many teams are trying to do incremental deployment based on the changes in a merge. This extension will help you generate such incremental deployment packages.
